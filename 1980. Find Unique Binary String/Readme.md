## Problem statement

Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` **unique** binary strings each of length `n`, return _a binary string of length `n` that **does not appear** in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return **any** of them._

### Example 1

>**Input:** nums = ["01","10"] <br />
>**Output:** "11" <br />
>**Explanation:** "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

### Example 2

>**Input:** nums = ["00","01"] <br />
>**Output:** "11" <br />
>**Explanation:** "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.

### Example 3

>**Input:** nums = ["111","011","001"] <br />
>**Output:** "101" <br />
>**Explanation:** "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 16`
- `nums[i].length == n`
- `nums[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- All the strings of `nums` are **unique**.
